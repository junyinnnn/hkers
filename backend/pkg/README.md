# pkg/

This directory contains public packages that can be imported by external applications.

For simple applications, this directory may remain empty. Use it when you have reusable
libraries that should be shared across multiple projects.

Examples of what might go here:
- Custom validators
- Utility functions
- Shared types/interfaces
